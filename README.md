# Catch the Animals  
Term project for my "Computer Graphics and Animation" course which I was enrolled in my senior year in university  
  
The player has a 1 minute time limit and they have to catch as many correct animals as they can!  
  
The animal to catch will be informed to the player through audio and text that can be seen at the bottom of the screen
